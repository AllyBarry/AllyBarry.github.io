## empowering the Next Generation

Since February 2023, I have been volunteering as a **Robotics Teacher** at **Vuleka St Martins, Jellicoe**, a non-profit primary school in Johannesburg. My goal is to introduce students from under-resourced backgrounds to the exciting world of STEM through hands-on learning.

### Activities
- **Curriculum Design**: Created age-appropriate lessons covering basic programming (Scratch), mechanics, and electronics.
- **Hands-On Workshops**: Facilitated weekly sessions where students build and program robots using Micro:bit and LEGO Education kits.
- **Fundraising**: Launched a successful Backabuddy campaign to raise funds for new equipment, ensuring every student has access to the tools they need.

### Outings & Events
I organize regular outings to science centers and tech companies to inspire the students and show them the real-world applications of what they learn in class.
