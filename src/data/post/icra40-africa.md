## Celebrating 40 Years of Robotics in Africa

I served on the organizing committee for the [**ICRA@40 Africa**](https://icra40.ieee.org/icra-2024/icra40-africa/) regional satellite event, held to celebrate the [40th anniversary of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)](https://icra40.ieee.org/).

### Role & Responsibilities
- **Logistics**: Helped organize the venue, catering, and schedule for attendees.
- **Delegate Coordination**: Engaged with local universities and research labs to arrange travel and accommodation for the invited delegates.
- **Event Management**: Ensured smooth operations during the event, including speaker sessions and networking breaks.

### Impact
This event brought together researchers, students, and industry professionals from across the continent to discuss the future of robotics in Africa. We highlighted local innovations and fostered new collaborations that will drive the field forward. I was humbled to see the incredible work being done with the aims of improving social circumstances and assisting in environmental conservation.
