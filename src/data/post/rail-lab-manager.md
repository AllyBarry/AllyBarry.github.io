## Managing the Robots in the RAIL Lab

As the **RAIL Lab Robotics Manager**, I oversee the robots in one of Africa's leading robotics research groups. My role is ensuring the robots are well maintained, have easy-to-run demos ready, and be able to assist any students looking to use them for their research.

### Robotic Fleet Management
I am responsible for maintaining a diverse fleet of robots, ensuring they are ready for experiments and demos:
- **SoftBank Pepper**: Humanoid robot for HRI research.
- **Clearpath Husky**: UGV for outdoor navigation.
- **Unitree A1**: Agile quadruped for locomotion research.
- **BlueRobotics BlueROV2**: Underwater vehicle for marine robotics.
- **ABB YuMi**: Dual-arm collaborative robot.
- **Drones**: Various aerial platforms for research.

### Documentation & Infrastructure
- **Knowledge Base**: Built and maintained the [RAIL Lab Documentation Portal](https://raillab.github.io/robot-docs/), writing comprehensive guides on "Getting Started," hardware usage, and simulation setups.
- **Tutorials**: Created hands-on tutorials for ROS, Gazebo, and physical robot operation to onboard new students quickly.
- **Safety**: Implemented and enforced lab safety protocols for handling high-voltage batteries and heavy machinery.
