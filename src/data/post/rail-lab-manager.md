## Managing the Robotics and Autonomous Intelligence Lab (RAIL)

As the **RAIL Lab Manager**, I oversaw the daily operations and technical infrastructure of one of Africa's leading robotics research groups. My role was to ensure that students and researchers had the reliable hardware and software tools they needed to succeed.

### Robotic Fleet Management
I was responsible for maintaining a diverse fleet of robots, ensuring they were ready for experiments and demos:
- **SoftBank Pepper**: Humanoid robot for HRI research.
- **Clearpath Husky**: UGV for outdoor navigation.
- **Unitree A1**: Agile quadruped for locomotion research.
- **BlueRobotics BlueROV2**: Underwater vehicle for marine robotics.
- **ABB YuMi**: Dual-arm collaborative robot.
- **Drones**: Various aerial platforms for research.

### Documentation & Infrastructure
- **Knowledge Base**: Built and maintained the [RAIL Lab Documentation Portal](https://raillab.github.io/robot-docs/), writing comprehensive guides on "Getting Started," hardware usage, and simulation setups.
- **Tutorials**: Created hands-on tutorials for ROS, Gazebo, and physical robot operation to onboard new students quickly.
- **Safety**: Implemented and enforced lab safety protocols for handling high-voltage batteries and heavy machinery.

My tenure significantly improved operational efficiency and lowered the learning curve for new lab members.
