## Robot Learning for Africa Workshop

I am part of the organizing committee for the **Robot Learning for Africa** workshop at the **Deep Learning Indaba 2025** in Rwanda. This workshop focuses on the intersection of modern machine learning techniques and robotics hardware, specifically tailored to the African context. The workshop was a component of the [Deep Learning Indaba 2025](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2025/).

### Workshop Goals
- **Accessibility**: Lowering the barrier to entry for robotics research by providing access to affordable hardware (e.g., Pepper, low-cost manipulators).
- **Education**: Providing hands-on tutorials on reinforcement learning, computer vision, and sim-to-real transfer.
- **Collaboration**: Building a network of African robot learning researchers.

The focus of this workshop was on **human pose estimation** and how these types of algorithms can improve robots' social interactions. By enabling the robot to accurately interpret human body language, we aim to create more natural and effective human-robot interactions in educational and service settings. I assisted with implementing the pose estimation algorithm onto a Pepper robot and overlaying it with Pepper's camera stream, so that the audience could see Pepper's perspective in real time.
