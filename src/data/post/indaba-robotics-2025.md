## Robot Learning for Africa Workshop

I am part of the organizing committee for the **Robot Learning for Africa** workshop at the **Deep Learning Indaba 2025** in Rwanda. This workshop focuses on the intersection of modern machine learning techniques and robotics hardware, specifically tailored to the African context.

### Workshop Goals
- **Accessibility**: Lowering the barrier to entry for robotics research by using affordable hardware (e.g., Pepper, low-cost manipulators).
- **Education**: Providing hands-on tutorials on reinforcement learning, computer vision, and sim-to-real transfer.
- **Collaboration**: Building a network of African robot learning researchers.

### My Contribution
My specific focus is on **human pose estimation** for the Pepper robot to improve its social adaptability. By enabling the robot to accurately interpret human body language, we aim to create more natural and effective human-robot interactions in educational and service settings.
