## Exploring the Sterkfontein Caves

In July 2024, the Caves research group from the **RAIL Lab** conducted a site visit to the world-renowned **Sterkfontein Caves**. This outing was the start of an affiliation with **National Geographic** to explore and document previously undocumented subterranean environments using advanced robotics technology.

### Research Objectives

The primary goal of the trip was to gather sensor data and test our systems in a real-world, unstructured environment. Projects in this domain focus on three areas thus far:

1.  **Safe Navigation in Dangerous Terrain**: Developing algorithms that allow robots to traverse uneven, slippery, and confined spaces without risking damage or getting stuck.
2.  **Adaptive Gait Control**: Enabling legged robots (like our Unitree A1) to modify their walking style in real-time based on the upcoming terrain features.
3.  **3D Reconstruction**: Using LiDAR and visual SLAM to create high-fidelity 3D maps of the cave systems, which are valuable for both robotic navigation and geological study.
