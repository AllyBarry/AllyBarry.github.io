## Research Exchange at ACT Lab

During my time at **Brown University**, I joined the **Automatic Coordination of Teams (ACT) Lab** as a visiting researcher under the supervision of **Prof. Nora Ayanian**. This exchange was a pivotal moment in my career, exposing me to cutting-edge research in swarm robotics and decentralized control.

### Research Focus
My work focused on **Distributed Coordination in UAV Swarms**, specifically exploring algorithms that allow drones to coordinate their movements without relying on a central controller or GPS. I investigated the use of UWB (Ultra-Wideband) technology and sensor fusion for precise localization in swarm robotics.

### Key Contributions
- **Algorithm Development**: Collaborated on the design of a novel consensus algorithm for multi-agent path planning.
- **Simulation**: Implemented and tested swarm behaviors in high-fidelity simulators to validate theoretical models.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Participated in lab seminars and presented my findings to the research group, fostering cross-pollination of ideas between Wits and Brown.
